The Universal Polyphonic Player (short UPP) is an infrastructure for all kinds of polyphonic events â€“ be it note-like events, other generated sounds or short grains in granular synthesis. The strengths of the system are a modular, easily extendible design, almost unlimited polyphony, ease of control, DSP load scaling and sample-accurate timing.

Please refer to the tutorials folder and the UPP web page for how to get started.
